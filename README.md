## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tictactoe.git
```

2. Open Android Studio
3. Select "Open an Existing Project"
4. Navigate to the cloned repository and click "OK"
5. Wait for the Gradle sync to complete
6. Run the app on an emulator or physical device

## Game Rules

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid
2. Players take turns placing their marks (X or O)
3. The first player uses X, the second player uses O
4. A player wins when they get 3 of their marks in a row:
   - Horizontally
   - Vertically
   - Diagonally
5. If the grid is full and no player has won, the game is a draw

## Code Overview

### MainActivity.java
- Contains the game logic
- Handles button clicks
- Checks for wins and draws
- Manages player turns
- Implements reset functionality

### activity_main.xml
- Defines the game board layout
- Uses Material Design components
- Implements grid-style button arrangement
- Includes reset button
- Supports accessibility features

## Customization

### Changing Theme Colors
Edit `res/values/colors.xml`:
```xml
<resources>
    <color name="primary">#YOUR_COLOR_HERE</color>
    <color name="primary_variant">#YOUR_DARK_COLOR_HERE</color>
    <color name="secondary">#YOUR_ACCENT_COLOR_HERE</color>
</resources>
```

### Modifying Grid Size
- Adjust button dimensions in `activity_main.xml`
- Default size is 100dp x 100dp for each cell

### Styling Text
- Modify `android:textSize` in button attributes
- Current size is 60sp for game pieces (X and O)
